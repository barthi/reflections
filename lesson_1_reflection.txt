How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    FC old_file new_file, and see one by one.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    see version history

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: manually commit make checkpoint more organized. cons: if we're forget to commit then the diff become big.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because it's in one repository.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    enter repository, type 'git log' and get the id of commit, then type 'git diff first_id second_id' and see the history.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    very confident to make change because I can go back to previous with checkout.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    create repository and try git feature.
